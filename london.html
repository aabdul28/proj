    <h1>London</h1>
    <p>
      London is a leading global city. It is the world's largest financial
      centre alongside New York, and is home to the headquarters of more than
      100 of Europe's 500 largest companies. It has the most international
      visitors of any city in the world. The World Nuclear Association Symposium
      will be held at Central Hall Westminster. Many of London’s top attractions
      lie only a short distance from here, such as Trafalgar Square, the
      National Gallery, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Buckingham Palace
      and St. James’s Park. The location is also within London’s “theatreland”
      and close to many of the capital’s best pubs, clubs, restaurants and
      shops.
