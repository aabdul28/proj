    <h1>Paris</h1>
    <p>
      Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of
      the country. People were living on the site of the present-day city,
      located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the
      river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) , by about 7600 BCE. The
      modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond
      both banks of the Seine.
