    <h1>Tokyo</h1>
    <p>
      The area now known as Tokyo began around the city of Edo, which
      established itself as a centre of commerce, art and high culture in Japan
      during the 17th and 18th centuries, known as the Edo period. It was
      renamed Tokyo and became the capital of Japan in 1869. During the late
      19th century Japan underwent rapid modernisation and cultural change,
      including the building of roads, railways and telecommunications lines.
      The city was heavily damaged by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, and
      later during World War Two. Cycles of economic boom and bust took place
      throughout the late 20th century, matched by the rise of consumerism and
      cycles of rapid population decline and growth in the city. Tokyo now has a
      population of over 13.9 million people in its centre and over 38 million
      in its metropolitan area, making it the largest city in the world.
